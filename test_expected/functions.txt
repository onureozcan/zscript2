i am the main fnc
now i am calling a function defined outside of me!
hello from the outer fnc
i am the inner fnc that is placed inside the outer fnc
here is the tricky part:
        I am not directly called by `some_outer_fnc` but through `main`.
        so, if you see this, it shows that I knew where I need to search for parent variables. yeey :) 
now let's call a function that returns a value
i can return values, how cool is not it? :D
now let me call a function and pass arguments to it
arg1arg2
now i will call a function, generating a function based on the parameter i have passed
look ma, i can return functions too: some arg 1
look ma, i can return functions too: some arg 2
look ma, i can return functions too: some arg 3
hey, nice function, i will call it now!
hello from the function that was passed to another function as a callback! and here is a variable from my parent context:something
